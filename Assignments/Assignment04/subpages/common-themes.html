			<p>Palahniuk's books prior to Lullaby have distinct similarities. The characters are people who have been <b>marginalized in one way or another by society</b>, and often <b>react with self-destructive aggressiveness</b>. He labels these stories as <i>"transgressional fiction"</i>. Beginning with Lullaby, the style of his novels changed to mostly <b>satirical horror stories.</b></p>
			<p>Palahniuk's writing often contains <b>anti-consumerist</b> themes. Writing about Fight Club, Paul Kennett argues that because the Narrator's fights with Tyler Durden are fights with himself, and because he fights himself in front of his boss at the hotel, the Narrator is using the fights as a way of asserting himself as his own boss. These fights are a representation of the struggle of the proletarian at the hands of a higher capitalist power; by asserting himself as capable of having the same power he thus becomes his own master. Later when fight club is formed, the participants are all dressed and groomed similarly, allowing them to symbolically fight themselves at the club and gain the same power. In an interview with HuffPost, Palahniuk says that "the central message of Fight Club was always about the <b>empowerment of the individual through small, escalating challenges</b>."</p>
