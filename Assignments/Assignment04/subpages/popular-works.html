			<p>Chuck has written over a dozen novels but the ones listed below are perhaps his most popular and iconic works. Several have even been adapted into films, including Fight Club staring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Chuck Palahniuk himself has been quoted as saying he believed that Fight Club the movie was so well done that it was better than the book he wrote.</p>
