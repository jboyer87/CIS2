# Assignment #02

This week I have asked you to create your first git repository and upload the contents to GitHub. You were tasked with building a basic single-page website with an external stylesheet and demonstrating your ability to use CSS type, class, and id selectors. You also were asked to make iterative updates ("commits") to your git repository and make sure that your code validates. 

What exists in this "Assignment02" folder is what I expect to see in your repository. Please review the index.html and the site.css files.
