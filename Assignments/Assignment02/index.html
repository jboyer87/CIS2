	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p class="question">What do you hope to learn in your HTML/CSS course?</p>
	
	<p>I hope to learn how to become a better instructor. HTML and CSS are very technical topics and I want to explore different approaches to sharing my knowledge with my students.</p>
	<p>Additionally, I'm hoping that my students can teach me some things as well. I think that a learner's perspective is very unique. I expect that each student will bring something new to the table. I have been doing this for a long time and take for granted a lot of the things that I have learned along the way. Seeing it from a fresh perspective will be an eye-opener.</p>
	<p>Finally, I hope to sharpen my time management skills. After the first lecture I felt that I was able to get a feel for how quickly our 3 hours together will fly by. I hope that experience allows me to better plan future lectures and manage our activity time together.</p>
