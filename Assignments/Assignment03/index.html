		<h1>A Chuck Palahniuk Tribute</h1>
		<div id="intro">
			<p>Chuck Palahniuk is an American novelist. He describes his work as <i>"transgressional fiction"</i> and writes mostly works of satire. Chuck is one of my favorite authors because his books make you question your life and your choices. Chuck's stories make me reflect on what kinds of things in life are actually important.</p>

			<h2>Early Life and Career</h2>

				<q>This is your life and it's ending one moment at a time</q>
			</div>

			<p>Palahniuk was born in Pasco, Washington, the son of Carol Adele (née Tallent) and Fred Palahniuk. He has French and Russian ancestry. His paternal grandfather migrated from Ukraine to Canada and then New York in 1907. Palahniuk grew up living in a mobile home in Burbank, Washington. His parents separated when he was 14 and subsequently divorced, often leaving him and his three siblings to live with their maternal grandparents at their cattle ranch in eastern Washington. Palahniuk acknowledged in a 2007 interview that he is a distant nephew of actor Jack Palance, and that his family had talked of distant relations with Palance.</p>
			<p>In his 20s, Palahniuk attended the University of Oregon School of Journalism, graduating in 1986. While attending college, he worked as an intern for National Public Radio member station KLCC in Eugene, Oregon. He moved to Portland, Oregon soon after. He wrote for the local newspaper for a short while and then began working for Freightliner as a diesel mechanic, continuing until his writing career took off. During that time, he wrote manuals on fixing trucks and had a stint as a journalist, a job to which he did not return until after he became a successful novelist. After casually attending a seminar held by an organization called Landmark Education, Palahniuk quit his job as a journalist in 1988. He performed volunteer work for a homeless shelter and volunteered at a hospice as an escort, providing transportation for terminally ill people and bringing them to support group meetings. He ceased volunteering upon the death of a patient to whom he had grown attached.</p>
			<p>Palahniuk began writing fiction in his mid-30s. By his account, he started writing while attending workshops for writers that were hosted by Tom Spanbauer, which he attended to meet new friends. Spanbauer largely inspired Palahniuk's minimalistic writing style.</p>

			<h2>Writing Style</h2>
			<div class="quote-wrapper">
				<q>Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I’ve ever known.</q>
			</div>

			<p>The narratives of Palahniuk's books often are structured in medias res, starting at the temporal end, with the protagonist recounting the events that led up to the point at which the book begins. Lullaby used a variation of this, alternating between the normal, linear narrative and the temporal end, after every few chapters. Exceptions to this narrative form, however, include the more linear Choke and Diary. Often a major plot twist exists that is revealed near the end of the book, which relates in some way to this temporal end (what Palahniuk refers to as "the hidden gun"). His more linear works also include similar plot twists.</p>

			<h2>Common Themes</h2>
			<div class="quote-wrapper">
				<q>You are not special. You're not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else. We're all part of the same compost heap. We're all singing, all dancing crap of the world.</q>
			</div>

			<p>Palahniuk's books prior to Lullaby have distinct similarities. The characters are people who have been <b>marginalized in one way or another by society</b>, and often <b>react with self-destructive aggressiveness</b>. He labels these stories as <i>"transgressional fiction"</i>. Beginning with Lullaby, the style of his novels changed to mostly <b>satirical horror stories.</b></p>
			<p>Palahniuk's writing often contains <b>anti-consumerist</b> themes. Writing about Fight Club, Paul Kennett argues that because the Narrator's fights with Tyler Durden are fights with himself, and because he fights himself in front of his boss at the hotel, the Narrator is using the fights as a way of asserting himself as his own boss. These fights are a representation of the struggle of the proletarian at the hands of a higher capitalist power; by asserting himself as capable of having the same power he thus becomes his own master. Later when fight club is formed, the participants are all dressed and groomed similarly, allowing them to symbolically fight themselves at the club and gain the same power. In an interview with HuffPost, Palahniuk says that "the central message of Fight Club was always about the <b>empowerment of the individual through small, escalating challenges</b>."</p>
