CIS002 Internet Programming (HTML &amp; CSS) Assignments

This repository contains all of the lecture activities, assignments, and a sample project that we will complete as part of CIS2. The assignments should be used as a learning tool in order for students to see what an "A+" assignment should look like. I will release completed assignments after the due date as a reference for you to see how I do things and what I expect of you in future assignments.
